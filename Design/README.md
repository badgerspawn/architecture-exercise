# NOTEs

This is my high level design document:
[My Answer](High-Level-Design.md)

Which is based on exercise described here:
[Architecture Exercise](../README.md)

It was completed within the time allocated.

Given more time I would:

1. Describe the steps I would take to ensure AKS security and high availability.
2. Describe K8s manifest/helm chart in more detail.
3. Add example CICD workflows and dockerfiles.

I look forward to discussing this and other aspects with you.
